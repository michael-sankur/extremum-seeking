# extremum-seeking

 Extremum Seeking (ES) is a model-free, online or offline, optimization algorithm that approximates gradient descent. ES estimates the gradient of a system by modulating the input to a system, then filtering and demodulation of an objective function value based on system output.

This project contains three implementations of extremum seeking, meant to be plug-and-play into simulations or real-world applications: 1D-ES, 2D-ES, ND-ES (multi-dimensional). Multiple ES instances of any type can be used in conjunction. Jupyter notebooks contain several simulation examples of the ES implementations on static and dynamic systems.
